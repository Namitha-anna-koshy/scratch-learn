##  Why I Did This to Myself

WELL WELL WELL.

I got bored. Really bored. So instead of doing something productive like a *real* project, I decided to **recreate basic ML algorithms from scratch** — **with zero built-in functions** — just to humble myself and annihilate what little self-esteem I had left. 😃👍

---

## What Even *Is* This?

A sad little collection of **simple ML algorithms** that I rewrote from the ground up using only **NumPy**, brain cells, and tears.

Because who needs `scikit-learn` when you can have an existential crisis instead?

##  What's Inside

| Algorithm              | Status       |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Linear Regression      | ✅ crying complete |
| Logistic Regression    | Done and dusted out of this world✨ |
| K-Means Clustering     | 🔜 chaos loading |
| Decision Trees         | 🔜 nope not yet |
| Neural Networks (??)   | 🚫 lol good joke |

## Tech Stack (if you can call it that)

- Python 3
-  NumPy
-  Sadness
-  Occasional brilliance (rare)

##  Dear Fellow Humans

Feel free to look around, steal code, cry with me, or silently judge me — I welcome it all 🙃  
This isn’t a tutorial. It’s more of a "watch-me-struggle" diary.

**Please don’t judge too hard. I already did that myself.**

##  How to Run This Dumpster Fire

Clone the repo and run the scripts like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Namitha-anna-koshy/scratch-learn.git
cd scratch-learn
python Linear_regression.py
```
Or open the `.ipynb` files if you're a Jupyter Notebook person (aka normal).

## To Do (aka stuff I’ll probably forget I said I’d do)

- [ ] Add more ML stuff  
- [ ] Pretend this is educational  
- [ ] Actually learn something new??  

---

##  Final Words

If this somehow helps you understand ML better... seek help.  
And maybe consider using `scikit-learn` like a functioning adult.

But hey — **thanks for being here. You're part of the chaos now 💖**
